sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get upgrade --fix-missing 
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade 

### These instructions are for the NVIDIA TX2 on the Connect Tech Inc. Orbitty Carrier. These arrived with Ubuntu 16.04 pre installed and the instructions start from that point.

#### 1. Update the OS:
- `sudo apt-get update`
- `sudo apt-get upgrade`
- `sudo apt-get upgrade --fix-missing`
- `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade` 
----------------------------
#### 2. Instal helper applications and software:
- Open the application called "Software & Updates" and under the heading "Download from the Internet":
	1. Check the box to enable Universe software, if prompted enter the admin password
	2. Check the box to enable Multiverse software
	3. Click on the "Close" button and then the "Reload" button
	4. If you receive an error message that starts with "E: Problem executing scripts APT::Update::Post-Invoke-Success" in a terminal:
		a. `sudo appstreamcli refresh-cache --force`
		b. `sudo apt-get update`
- `sudo apt-get install -y meld mlocate minicom ant git gitk gksu openssh-server terminator gparted`
----------------------------
#### 3. Extend length of History
- In the ~/.bashrc file change the below settings to lengthen the history file. Just add a couple zeroâ€™s to each setting.
- HISTSIZE=100000
- HISTFILESIZE=200000
- *REASON: This makes it much easier to find what was done to the computer in the past. Many of the users on these systems are not familiar with Linux. The ability to search the terminal history for commands and the way it was done last semester has proven valuable, especially at the start of the semester. It has also allowed Faculty to figure out what the users have done on the computer for debugging problems. The long length has proven its value mostly when trying to recreate work done in the previous school year. 
** This justifies a reminder that the work done on these computers is not private. **
----------------------------
#### 4. Modify Power Saving
- Go to System Settings -> All Settings -> Brightness & Lock
- Set "Turn screen off when inactive for: 1 hour"
- Disable screen lock
- *REASON: The auto-lock is more of an inconvenience and may cause errors while in the midst of a critical operation.*
----------------------------
#### 5. Disable bluetooth on start up - NA
----------------------------
#### 6. Edit Terminal's Default Profile
- Open Terminal. Click on Edit -> Profile Preferences
- On the Scrolling tab, uncheck the box "Limit scrollback to:"
- On the Scrolling tab, uncheck the box "Scroll on output"
- *REASON: Many times the output to the terminal sent by a build command exceeds this limit. To understand build problems, many times you need to scroll to the beginning of the output. This enables you to scroll back to the beginning of the buffer.*
----------------------------
#### 7. GEDIT Preferences.
- Open a text file using Gedit or type `gedit` in a terminal window and hit enter. This brings up the text editor.
- Click Edit -> Preferences -> Editor. 
- Change Tab width to 4 , Check the box for "Insert spaces instead of tabs"
- *REASON: The default 8 spaces per tab makes reading source code difficult. 4 spaces is an acceptable convention used by industry. Changing tabs to spaces as a convention is helpful when programming in Python or any other language that relies on indentation.*
----------------------------
#### 8. Firefox Preferences - NA
----------------------------
#### 9. Scroll bars on the side of windows - NA
----------------------------
#### 10. Allow user1 to dialout on USB devices
 - `sudo adduser user1 dialout`
 - *REASON: This allows user1 to read and write to most serial devices such as USB. Most robotics projects require this.*
 ----------------------------
#### 11. Disable automatic updates
- System Settings -> Software & Updates -> Updates
- Uncheck 'Unsupported updates'
- Set 'Automatically check for updates: Never'
- Set 'When there are other updates: Display every two weeks'
- *REASON: Some updates can introduce unexpected changes into the behavior of the robots. The cadets usually wont track the updates they've applied. Its best for the system admin (OIC/RRC/CSG) to manually update the laptop before handing out to cadets. Cadets can always use `sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get upgrade` if requrired.*
----------------------------
#### 12. Install ROS Kinetic Kame
- Follow instructions on the [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) for a full-desktop install. CHOOSE TO INSTALL: ros-kinetic-desktop-full.
-----------------------------
#### 13. Install additional tools
- `sudo apt-get install git-core python-argparse python-wstool python-vcstools python-rosdep ros-kinetic-control-msgs ros-kinetic-joystick-drivers`
-----------------------------
#### 14. Create catkin workspace
- `mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src`
- `cd ~/catkin_ws/src`
- `catkin_init_workspace`
- `cd ~/catkin_ws/`
- `catkin_make`
- `echo "source $HOME/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc`
- `source $HOME/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash`
- `rospack profile`
-----------------------------
#### 15. Turtlebot
- `sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-turtlebot-*`
- If the above command does not work, follow installation instructions provided in [this tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/kinetic/Turtlebot%20Installation). These commands were framed for indigo. Hence you'll have to change the distro names in all the commands to 'kinetic'.
----------------------------
#### 16. Environmental variables that must be set for minimal.launch to run.
- Copy and paste the following lines to `~/.bashrc` file:
```
export TURTLEBOT_BASE=kobuki
export TURTLEBOT_BATTERY="/sys/class/power_supply/BAT1"
export TURTLEBOT_STACKS=hexagons
export TURTLEBOT_3D_SENSOR=astra
export TURTLEBOT_SIMULATION=false
export TURTLEBOT_SERIAL_PORT=/dev/kobuki
```
-----------------------------
#### 18. Orbbec Astra RGB-D camera [[1]](http://wiki.ros.org/astra_camera)
- Plug in the camera and let the drivers auto-install
- `gksu gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/56-orbbec.rules`
- Add the lines contained in [this](https://github.com/westpoint-robotics/os-setup/blob/master/orbbec_camera_udev.txt) text file.
- Save and close text editor.
- Unplug the camera, run `sudo service udev reload` and then `sudo service udev restart`.
- Plug the camera back and it should run with the ROS packages now.
-----------------------------
#### 17. Turtlebot Player Stage Gazebo (Optional)
- Copy the map files to ~/stage by:
 - `mkdir ~/stage`
 - `cp -Rf /opt/ros/kinetic/share/turtlebot_stage/maps/ ~/stage/maps/`
 - `mkdir ~/gazebo`
 - `cp -Rf /opt/ros/kinetic/share/turtlebot_gazebo/worlds/ ~/gazebo/worlds`
- `export TURTLEBOT_STAGE_MAP_FILE=~/stage/maps/maze.yaml`
- `export TURTLEBOT_STAGE_WORLD_FILE=~/stage/maps/stage/maze.world`
- `export TURTLEBOT_GAZEBO_WORLD_FILE=~/gazebo/worlds/playground.world`
- To run player stage 2d simultation: `roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage.launch`
- To run gazebo 3d simulation, after stopping all the 2d processess: 
 - `roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch`
 - `roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_robot.launch`
 - `roslaunch turtlebot_teleop xbox360_teleop.launch`







Add the GPIO pins to the dial out group on boot up by editing the file /etc/rc.local and adding the below two lines.

chgrp -R dialout /sys/class/gpio
chmod -R g+rw /sys/class/gpio
